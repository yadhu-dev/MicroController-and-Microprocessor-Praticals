# 9 to 0 and 0 to 9 Counter Program

This program is only for reference and demonstrates a simple counter logic that first counts **down from 9 to 0**, and then counts **up from 0 to 9**, repeating continuously in a loop.

## Program Description

The program utilizes a 7-segment display to show numbers starting from **9**, decrementing down to **0**, and then incrementing back up to **9** in a continuous loop. It is intended for embedded systems, such as those using the 8051 microcontroller.

The logic of the program works as follows:

1. **Countdown from 9 to 0**: 
   - The counter starts at 9 and decrements down to 0.
   
2. **Count up from 0 to 9**:
   - After reaching 0, the counter increments from 0 back to 9.
   
3. **Looping Behavior**:
   - The counting process repeats in a continuous loop: 9 to 0, then 0 to 9, and so on.

4. **Display on 7-Segment**:
   - The numbers are displayed using a 7-segment display connected to the microcontroller.
