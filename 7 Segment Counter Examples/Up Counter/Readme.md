## Program Description

The program utilizes a 7-segment display to show numbers starting from **0**, incrementing up to **9**, and then restarting from **0** in a continuous loop. It is intended for embedded systems, such as those using the 8051 microcontroller.

The logic of the program works as follows:

1. **Count up from 0 to 9**: 
   - The counter starts at 0 and increments up to 9.
   
2. **Looping Behavior**:
   - Once the counter reaches 9, it immediately resets to 0 and the process starts again.

3. **Display on 7-Segment**:
   - The numbers are displayed using a 7-segment display connected to the microcontroller.
