## Program Description

The program utilizes a 7-segment display to show numbers starting from **9**, decrementing to **0**, and then restarting from **9** in a continuous loop. It is intended for embedded systems, such as those using the 8051 microcontroller.

The logic of the program works as follows:

1. **Countdown from 9 to 0**: 
   - The counter starts at 9 and decrements down to 0.
   
2. **Looping Behavior**:
   - Once the counter reaches 0, it immediately resets to 9 and the process starts again.

3. **Display on 7-Segment**:
   - The numbers are displayed using a 7-segment display connected to the microcontroller.

This program is provided **only for reference** purposes. It is not intended for production use and may require adjustments based on specific hardware configurations and project requirements.
